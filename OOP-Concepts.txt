What is OOPS?
Object Oriented Progamming is a certain way of writing code that represents real world 
through the creation objects.

-----

1. "Object" - Real world entities. (Eg: ONE-UI)
2. "Class" - Blueprint of these entities. (Eg: Android OS)
3. "Methods" - Functions or propeties stored inside a class/ object.

"Classes and Objects" - Create a class or a Blueprint which can be replicated by varoius objects
defined inside the class sharing similar properties. This will reduce code repition as class and
objects are used instead of too many variables and enhance re-usability.

Eg: Amazon
Amazon has varoius products and each product has varoius properties/ methods like name, 
description, price, etc.
Hence, here amazon must have used a Blueprint for all the products to include these 
common properties and each listed product would then be called as an individual object inside 
the class "Product".

-----

"Access Specifiers":
1. private (default) - data/members are only accesible inside the 
class itself. 
2. public - data/members are accesible globally.
3. protected - data/members are accesible inside drived classes.

-----

"Encapsulation":
Encapsulation is wrapping up of data members/ properties and methods/
member-functions in a single unit or a capsule, i.e. class. 
-Helps in Data hiding by using access specifiers.
